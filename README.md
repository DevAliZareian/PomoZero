# PomoZero

A **React-based Pomodoro Timer** designed to help users enhance productivity by following the **Pomodoro Technique**—a time management method that breaks work into focused intervals, separated by short breaks. Inspired by [pomofocus.io](https://pomofocus.io/), this app offers an intuitive interface, precise time tracking, and customizable settings to fit different work styles.
